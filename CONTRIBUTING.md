# Contributing to NetboxTools

You are more than welcome to contribute to the NetboxTools module, whether it is [Pull Requests](#pull-requests), [Feature Suggestions](#feature-suggestions) or [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)!

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo (see [this forking guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more information).
- Checkout the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/NetboxTools.git`.
- If you haven't already, you will need the [Microsoft.Powershell.PlatyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) PowerShell Module to generate command help and docs.

## Developing

### Structure

The repo is organized as below:

- **Private** (`Source/Private`): All private functions used by the module.
- **Public** (`Source/Public`): All functions exported by the module.
- **Classes** (`Source/Classes`): All classes by the module.
- **Tests** (`Tests`): Pester tests executed at Pull Request.
- **Help** (`Docs\Help`): Markdown help files for external help.

### Running the module locally

- Import the module:

```powershell
Import-Module .\Source\NetboxTools.psd1
```

### Tests

The NetboxTools module is developed using Test-driven development(TDD) where we aim for full test coverage for all our functions. Make sure that all new features and updates are covered by Pester tests. All tests will be executed when a Pull Request is submitted as a build validation step. PRs with failing tests will not be approved.

[Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) is the ubiquitous test and mock framework for PowerShell.

Exclusion of standard tests can be done using the SkipTest attribute.

```PowerShell
[SkipTest('TestName')]
```

Introducing additional exclusions should be discussed in a GitHub issue before implementation.

### Microsoft.Powershell.PlatyPS

[Microsoft.Powershell.PlatyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) is used to write the external help in markdown. When contributing always make sure that the changes are added to the help file.

#### Quickstart

- Install the Microsoft.Powershell.PlatyPS module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com):

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Powershell.PlatyPS -Scope CurrentUser
Import-Module Microsoft.Powershell.PlatyPS
```

- Create initial Markdown help file for `NetboxTools` module (This will only create help files for new commands, existing files will not be overwritten):

```powershell
# you should have module imported in the session
Import-Module .\Source\NetboxTools.psd1
New-MarkdownCommandHelp -Command (Get-Command My-NewCommand) -OutputFolder .\Docs\Help
```
Move the newly creaated markdown from `.\Docs\Help\NetboxTools` to `.\Docs\Help` folder and populate `{{ ... }}` placeholders with missed help content.

- If you've made a lot of changes to the module code, you can easily update the markdown file(s) automatically with:

```powershell
# re-import your module with latest changes
Import-Module .\Source\NetboxTools.psd1 -Force
Update-MarkdownHelp .\Docs\Help
```
